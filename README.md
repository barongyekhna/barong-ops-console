# Barong Ops Console

Barong Ops Console is the control-panel foundation for the Barong Yekhna independent-site automation operating system.

This project must be built as an independent containerized console and must not modify existing production n8n, Filebrowser, MinIO, WooCommerce, or legacy Baisuwan containers directly.

Core rule:
- Build the empty foundation first.
- Add business modules one by one.
- Every module must be registered, isolated, testable, and removable.
